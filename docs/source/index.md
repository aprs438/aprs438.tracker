Welcome to the documentation of the **APRS&nbsp;438 Tracker**, part of
the 438&nbsp;MHz amateur radio LoRa [automatic packet reporting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) that **extends range by saving bytes.**

:::{caution}
Unlike the vast majority of [other LoRa projects](https://thethingsnetwork.org), the firmware of this project employs **licensed frequency spectrum** exclusive to the use of [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio). **You need a valid amateur radio license to be able to use APRS 438 firmware.**
Contact your national government or local amateur radio club to find out how to obtain an amateur radio license.
